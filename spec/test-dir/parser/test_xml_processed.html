<b>summary</b>: <pre>
      This protocol will collect blood samples and medical information from patients who have had
      a bone marrow transplant using cells from an unrelated donor identified through the National
      Marrow Donor Program (NMDP). The NMDP has two programs in which patients can participate:
      the Research Database Program and the Research Sample Repository.

      Patients who have received a bone marrow transplant at the NIH or other institution from an
      unrelated donor affiliated with the NMDP may be eligible for this study.

      Participants in the NMDP Research Database program will have medical information about their
      disease and their transplant sent to the NMDP before and after the transplant and once a
      year for the rest of their life. The information will be used to help determine how well
      transplant recipients recover from their transplant, how recovery after a transplant can be
      improved, how access to transplant for different groups of patients can be improved and how
      well donors recover from collection procedures.

      Participants in the NMDP Research Sample Repository program will have a small blood sample
      drawn from a vein in the arm just before they start taking medicines for the conditioning
      regimen to prepare them for the transplant.  The blood samples will be used to look at ways
      to improve how patients are matched with their donors, to determine and evaluate the factors
      that affect transplant outcome, and to help develop methods to improve tissue matching
      between donors and recipients.
